## About the Collection

This is a demo collection to practice using CB-GH. I hope to learn how to:

- Use Markdown
- Use the GitHub web interface

## Collection History

This is a paragraph about my collection. 

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
